\title{Generate simulated mixed-type data with cluster structure.}
\usage{
genMixedData(sampSize, nConVar, nCatVar, nCatLevels, nConWithErr, nCatWithErr,
  popProportions, conErrLev, catErrLev)
}
\arguments{
\item{sampSize}{Integer: Size of the simulated data set.}

\item{nConVar}{The number of continuous variables.}

\item{nCatVar}{The number of categorical variables.}

\item{nCatLevels}{Integer: The number of categories per categorical variables. Currently must be a multiple of the number of populations specified in popProportions.}

\item{nConWithErr}{Integer: The number of continuous variables with error.}

\item{nCatWithErr}{Integer: The number of categorical variables with error.}

\item{popProportions}{A vector of scalars that sums to one. The length gives the number of populations (clusters), with values denoting the prior probability of observing a member of the corresponding population. NOTE: currently only two populations are supported.}

\item{conErrLev}{A scalar between 0.01 and 1 denoting the univariate overlap between clusters on the continuous variables specified to have error.}

\item{catErrLev}{Univariate overlap level for the categorical variables with error.}
}
\value{
A list with the following elements:
\item{trueID}{Integer vector giving population (cluster) membership of each observation}
\item{trueMus}{Mean parameters used for population (cluster) centers in the continuous variables}
\item{conVars}{The continuous variables}
\item{errVariance}{Variance parameter used for continuous error distribution}
\item{popProbsNoErr}{Multinomial probability vectors for categorical variables without measurement error}
\item{popProbsWithErr}{Multinomial probability vectors for categorical variables with measurement error}
\item{catVars}{The categorical variables}
}
\description{
This function simulates mixed-type data sets with a latent cluster
structure, with continuous and nominal variables.
}
\details{
This function simulates mixed-type data sets with a latent cluster
structure. Continuous variables follow a normal mixture model, and
categorical variables follow a multinomial mixture model. Overlap of the
continuous and categorical variables (i.e. how clear the cluster structure
is) can be manipulated by the user. The default overlap level is 1 percent
(i.e. almost perfect separation), and a user-specified number of continuous
and categorical variables can be specified to be measured with error, in
which case the overlap can be selectively set to be anywhere within 1 and
100 percent (100 percent corresponds to complete overlap).

NOTE: Currently, only two populations (clusters) are supported.
