\title{Classify new data into existing KAMILA clusters}
\usage{
classifyKamila(obj, newData)
}
\arguments{
\item{obj}{An output object from the kamila function.}

\item{newData}{A list of length 2, with first element a data frame of continuous variables, and second element a data frame of categorical factors.}
}
\value{
An integer vector denoting cluster assignments of the new data points.
}
\description{
A function that classifies a new data set into existing KAMILA clusters
using the output object from the kamila function.
}
\details{
A function that takes obj, the output from the kamila function, and newData,
a list of length 2, where the first element is a data frame of continuous
variables, and the second element is a data frame of categorical factors.
Both data frames must have the same format as the original data used
to construct the kamila clustering.
